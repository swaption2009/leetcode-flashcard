      "title": "297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree",
      "description": "Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.\n\nDesign an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.",

      "algorithm": "A **pre-order traversal (DFS)** is a natural fit for this problem because the root always comes first, making reconstruction straightforward.\n\n**`serialize(root)`:**\n1.  Use a recursive DFS helper function `dfs(node)`.\n2.  **Inside `dfs(node)`:**\n    -   **Base Case:** If `node` is `None`, append a special marker (e.g., `\"N\"`) to a list of values.\n    -   **Recursive Step:** Append the `node.val` (as a string) to the list. Then, recursively call `dfs` for the left and right children.\n3.  Join the list of values with a separator (e.g., a comma) to form the final serialized string.\n\n**`deserialize(data)`:**\n1.  Split the input string `data` by the separator to get a list of values.\n2.  Use a global index or a queue (`collections.deque`) to keep track of the current value to be processed.\n3.  Define a recursive helper function `build()`.\n4.  **Inside `build()`:**\n    -   Get the next value from the list/queue.\n    -   **Base Case:** If the value is the null marker (`\"N\"`), return `None`.\n    -   **Recursive Step:** Create a new `TreeNode` with the current value (converted to an integer).\n    -   Recursively call `build()` to construct the left subtree and assign it to `node.left`.\n    -   Recursively call `build()` to construct the right subtree and assign it to `node.right`.\n    -   Return the created `node`.\n5.

    "answer": {
      "algorithm": "This is a challenging but classic **Sliding Window** problem. The core idea is to expand a window until it's \"valid\" (contains all characters of `t`) and then contract it from the left to find the minimum possible size for that valid window.\n\n1.  Create a frequency map `t_freq` for all characters in `t`.\n2.  Initialize `window_freq` for the current window, a `left` pointer, `result_len = infinity`, and `result_indices = [-1, -1]`.\n3.  We need two counters: `required_chars` (the number of unique characters in `t`) and `formed_chars` (the number of unique characters in the current window that meet their required frequency).\n4.  Iterate with a `right` pointer through `s`. For each character `char_r`:\n    -   Add `char_r` to `window_freq`.\n    -   If `char_r` is in `t_freq` and its count in the window now matches its required count in `t_freq`, increment `formed_chars`.\n5.  **Contract Window:** Once `formed_chars == required_chars`, the window is valid.\n    -   Enter a `while` loop to shrink the window from the left.\n    -   Update the minimum window size found so far if the current window is smaller.\n    -   Get the character `char_l` at the `left` pointer. Move `left` pointer forward.\n    -   Decrement the count of `char_l` in `window_freq`.\n    -   If `char_l` is a required character and its count in the window just dropped below its required frequency, decrement `formed_chars`. This will break the `while` loop, and we'll go back to expanding the window with the `right` pointer.\n6.  After the main loop, if `result_len` is still infinity, no window was found. Otherwise, use `result_indices` to return the substring.",
